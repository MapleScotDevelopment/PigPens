# Pig Pens - A Simple Strategy Game for Young Kids

Pig Pens is a board game based on Pen the Pigs (AKA dots and lines, AKA squares)

See <a href="http://maple.scot/index.php/our-games/18-pig-pens">here</a> for how to make your own Pig Pens physical board game to play at home.

It is a simple game aimed at children from 4 years and up.

### Background

I've been a hobbiest game developer for a number of years.
Most of the games I have developed have been in Java using the libGdx framework in collaberation with my friend Troy Peterson.

As most of Troy's time for the last 18 months has been spent developing a trading system and turning that into a software company I have mostly been developing games on my own but still in libGdx.

Recently I decided to try making a game in Unity. I had done a bit of C# before at one of my clients so was comfortable enough with the language but wanted to see how different it was using a full blown engine.

I have made the game open source because I don't really consider the game idea to be mine and because I would very much like some constructive criticism on the game and how I have made it work in Unity.

### Licence

The source code that I have written is CC0.
There are a couple of places where I have found some code on the internet and modified it to suit.
**TO-DO**: Add list of source files

The graphic assets are CC3-BY. They are used in other games so I need to protect them in some small way.

The sound assets are CC0.

### Dependencies

In the full game there are two wav files that came from a purchased licensed unity asset. Obviously I have not included them here.
These are the click sound when pressing buttons and the audience cheering sound. All other sounds where freely available and I have modified them to fit the game.

The game depends on the DOTween and TextMeshPro unity assets which are freely available on the asset store.


### How to Play

It is a simple game aimed at children from 4 years and up.

See the maple.scot website for how to make your own Pig Pens physical board game to play at home.

The video game is mostly the same as the physical game.

#### Rules
Each Player picks a colour of Piggy and is given

* 6 piggies for a 2 player game
* 5 piggies for a 3 player game
* 4 piggies for a 4 player game

Play starts with the Pink pig and moves clockwise

Each player takes a turn going to the barn to get a fence piece. Spin the spinner to find out what you get from the barn.

* 1 Fence piece - Take a fence piece and place it on the board at the edge of a square
* 2 Fence pieces - Take 2 fence pieces and place them on the board at the edges of squares
* Bad Piggy - The bad piggy runs away - miss this turn

Closing a pen - If you can place a fence piece to finish a square then you win that square - 1 of your piggies will jump in that square and OINK with satisfaction!

The winner is the first player to pen all of their piggies.
 

#### Strategy
It's a good idea not to give pens away. Try to place your fences so that the next player can't steal a pen from you.

It's a good lesson for young children to learn
