# Pig Pens - A Simple Strategy Game for Young Kids

Pig Pens is a board game based on Pen the Pigs (AKA dots and lines, AKA squares)

See <a href="http://maple.scot/index.php/our-games/18-pig-pens">here</a> for how to make your own Pig Pens physical board game to play at home.

It is a simple game aimed at children from 4 years and up.

** Background

I've been a hobbiest game developer for a number of years.
Most of the games I have developed have been in Java using the libGdx framework in collaberation with my friend Troy Peterson.

As most of Troy's time for the last 18 months has been spent developing a trading system and turning that into a software company I have mostly been developing games on my own but still in libGdx.

Recently I decided to try making a game in Unity. I had done a bit of C# before at one of my clients so was comfortable enough with the language but wanted to see how different it was using a full blown engine.

I have made the game open source because I don't really consider the game idea to be mine and because I would very much like some constructive criticism on the game and how I have made it work in Unity.

** Licence

The source code that I have written is CC0.
There are a couple of places where I have found some code on the internet and modified it to suit.

** Dependencies

In the full game there are two wav files that came from a purchased licensed unity asset. Obviously I have not included them here.
These are the click sound when pressing buttons and the audience cheering sound. All other sounds where freely available and I have modified them to fit the game.

The game depends on the DOTween and TextMeshPro unity assets which are freely available on the asset store.
